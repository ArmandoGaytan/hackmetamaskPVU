# hackmetamaskPVU
Friends, I need your help or advice, my PVU account and assets have just been hacked. Yesterday afternoon with my first NFT I was able to exchange 7000LE, to buy a second floor. The fact is that I had 50.67 PVU to use it in the marketplace, but at night-dawn (CDMX time), someone made a transfer of my PVU assets leaving me at 0. I would not like to lose my first NFT because the solution would be to change Wallet in metamask. But neither in my house I can add another account because there would already be 3 (Currently my wife and I play). I do not know what I can do so that I could change my assets to another Wallet so that the account would not continue to be misused. I hope for your help since I am desperate because I can even get into the game with my account, sell my plant without my noticing and then withdraw all my capital. Greetings and that you are perfectly.
